In this project. We have taken the financial root to help the owner of adventureworks make better business decisions. The results will give them an idea of which products are the best, which are being returned the most and general stats that may be of help to the company such as which salary range of customers do we need to focus our marketing on.

The 8 tables we have Loaded are:

* AdventureWorks_Calendar
* AdventureWorks_Customers
* AdventureWorks_Product_Categories
* AdventureWorks_Product_Subcategories
* AdventureWorks_Products
* AdventureWorks_Returns
* AdventureWorks_Sales_2015
* AdventureWorks_Sales_2016
* AdventureWorks_Sales_2017
* AdventureWorks_Territories

## ETL Process
We Extracted the data as a .csv from the above website and converted it into our Pnadas 
Dataframe. We had to Transform our data by cleaning in Jupyter notebook, for example take
out the ‘$’ signs from some columns to get it ready to load and taking out any unnecessary 
columns

## Visualizations 
Our aim is to make our dashboard as user friendly as possible. Allowing the end user to be 
able to explore the Adventureworks sales data themselves. Creating Graphs and maps to 
compare our findings. Possible interactive graphs we will be using are:
Bar Chart 
Pie Chart
